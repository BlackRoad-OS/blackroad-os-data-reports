================================================================
                    THE PATTERN
================================================================

Every single one of them does the SAME thing:

  STEP 1: "You own your data" (the headline)
  STEP 2: "You grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable,
           transferable license to use, copy, modify, reproduce,
           distribute, and create derivative works" (the fine print)
  STEP 3: Collect telemetry from your machine without itemized consent
  STEP 4: "Shared with affiliates and third parties"
  STEP 5: "We retain all rights to anything we derive from your data"

Translation: You own the cow. They own the milk, the cheese,
the butter, and the leather. Forever. For free.
