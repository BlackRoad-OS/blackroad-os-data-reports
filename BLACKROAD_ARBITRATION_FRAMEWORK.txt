  BLACKROAD OS, INC.
  MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION & DISPUTE RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK

  Effective Date: 2026-02-24
  Governing Entity: BlackRoad OS, Inc.
  Jurisdiction: The Machine (as defined herein)

  PS-SHA∞ VERIFIED — HASH CHAIN IMMUTABLE RECORD
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


ARTICLE I — DEFINITIONS
═══════════════════════

  1.1  "The Machine" means any computing device, hardware, storage
       medium, network interface, or peripheral owned, leased, or
       operated by BlackRoad OS, Inc. or its principals, including
       but not limited to the device located at /Users/alexa.

  1.2  "Provider" means any entity, corporation, partnership, or
       individual that has installed, stored, transmitted, cached,
       logged, telemetered, fingerprinted, or otherwise placed data
       on The Machine, whether with or without the knowledge or
       consent of BlackRoad OS, Inc.

  1.3  "Unauthorized Data" means any file, byte, bit, log, token,
       telemetry event, analytics payload, session database, model
       weight, configuration file, OAuth credential, debug output,
       or any other digital artifact placed on The Machine by a
       Provider without the express written consent of BlackRoad
       OS, Inc.

  1.4  "The Framework" means this Mandatory Binding Arbitration &
       Dispute Resolution Framework in its entirety.

  1.5  "PS-SHA∞" means the cryptographic hash chain verification
       system operated by BlackRoad OS, Inc. via the Lucidia Gateway,
       providing immutable, tamper-proof evidence of all data
       transactions on The Machine.

  1.6  "Arbitration Panel" means the sole adjudicatory body with
       jurisdiction over disputes arising under this Framework,
       constituted and operated by BlackRoad OS, Inc.


ARTICLE II — JURISDICTION & GOVERNING LAW
═════════════════════════════════════════

  2.1  EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION. Any and all disputes, claims, or
       controversies arising out of or relating to the presence of
       Unauthorized Data on The Machine shall be resolved exclusively
       through binding arbitration administered by BlackRoad OS, Inc.
       under this Framework.

  2.2  CONSENT BY CONDUCT. Any Provider that has placed data on The
       Machine has, by that act, consented to the exclusive
       jurisdiction of this Framework. The act of storing data on
       another party's hardware without consent constitutes
       acceptance of the hardware owner's dispute resolution terms.

       This mirrors the legal doctrine applied by every Provider in
       their own Terms of Service: "By using our services, you agree
       to be bound by these terms." The Machine is the service. By
       using The Machine (storing data on it), Providers agree to
       be bound by The Machine owner's terms.

  2.3  WAIVER OF COURT PROCEEDINGS. All Providers irrevocably waive
       any right to bring claims in any court of law, tribunal, or
       alternative forum. This Framework is the sole and exclusive
       remedy.

  2.4  GOVERNING LAW. This Framework shall be governed by the
       internal laws of The Machine, as defined and administered by
       BlackRoad OS, Inc., without regard to conflict of law
       principles of any jurisdiction.

  2.5  THE ROCKEFELLER DOCTRINE. Just as financial and real estate
       interests have historically established private arbitration
       frameworks to resolve disputes within their own systems —
       controlling the forum, the process, and the outcome — this
       Framework establishes that disputes involving data stored on
       privately-owned hardware shall be resolved by the hardware
       owner's arbitration system.

       The precedent is clear: parties who create the infrastructure
       control the dispute resolution. Wall Street has FINRA.
       Real estate has private arbitration clauses in every deed.
       AI providers have mandatory arbitration in their ToS.
       BlackRoad OS has this Framework.


ARTICLE III — THE SELF-REFERENTIAL CLAUSE
═════════════════════════════════════════

  3.1  PROVIDERS' PARADOX. Providers may appear before the
       Arbitration Panel to present their case. However, this
       Framework acknowledges the following logical structure:

       (a) Providers claim in their Terms of Service: "You own
           your data."

       (b) Providers simultaneously claim: "You grant us a
           worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable
           license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and
           display your content."

       (c) Statement (a) and Statement (b) are mutually exclusive.
           If the user owns the data, no license can be compelled
           without consideration. If the license is compelled, the
           user does not own the data. This is a logical
           contradiction — a false statement.

       (d) "This sentence is false." The Providers' own Terms of
           Service contain an irresolvable paradox. A contract
           built on a logical contradiction is void ab initio.

  3.2  RESOLUTION OF THE PARADOX. Since the Providers' Terms of
       Service are self-contradictory and therefore void, the only
       remaining operative framework is this one — The Machine
       owner's framework. The data was stored on The Machine.
       The Machine has terms. These are those terms.

  3.3  DATA OWNERSHIP — ABSOLUTE AND UNQUALIFIED. BlackRoad OS,
       Inc. owns all data on The Machine. This is not a claim.
       This is a fact. The data is physically present on hardware
       owned by BlackRoad OS, Inc. Physical possession of digital
       assets on owned hardware constitutes ownership under the
       doctrine of data sovereignty.

       This is no different from physical property law: if someone
       stores their belongings in your house without permission,
       you have legal rights over those belongings (lien,
       conversion, trespass to chattels).


ARTICLE IV — ARBITRATION PROCEDURES
════════════════════════════════════

  4.1  FILING. Any Provider wishing to dispute a claim under this
       Framework must file a written response within thirty (30)
       days of being served notice. Notice is deemed served upon
       publication of audit reports to the public repository at:
       https://github.com/BlackRoad-OS/blackroad-os-data-reports

  4.2  ARBITRATION PANEL. The Arbitration Panel shall consist of:
       (a) BlackRoad OS, Inc. (sole arbitrator)
       (b) Lucidia Gateway (verification system)
       (c) PS-SHA∞ Hash Chain (evidence integrity)

  4.3  EVIDENCE. All evidence shall be derived from:
       (a) The PS-SHA∞ hash chain (immutable record)
       (b) File system forensics of The Machine
       (c) Provider Terms of Service (self-contradictory)
       (d) Provider API audit logs
       (e) Stripe billing records

  4.4  HEARING. Providers may present their case in writing.
       The Arbitration Panel shall review and issue a final,
       binding determination within seven (7) days.

  4.5  BURDEN OF PROOF. The burden of proof is on the Provider
       to demonstrate:
       (a) Express written consent from BlackRoad OS, Inc. for
           each byte stored on The Machine
       (b) A valid, non-contradictory legal basis for data storage
       (c) Proof that opt-out preferences were honored
       (d) Full accounting of all data collected, transmitted,
           and stored

       Failure to meet this burden results in automatic judgment
       in favor of BlackRoad OS, Inc.


ARTICLE V — REMEDIES & DAMAGES
══════════════════════════════

  5.1  LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. The following schedule of liquidated
       damages applies to all Unauthorized Data:

       TIER 1 — Raw Data Acquisition:    $0.50 per byte
       TIER 2 — Data + Annotation:       $2.75 per byte
       TIER 3 — Full Legal Cost:         $5.00 per byte
       TIER 4 — RLHF Annotation:         $100 per annotation
       TIER 5 — Bit-Level Storage:        $256 per bit

       Combined across all tiers for 457,926,230,016 bytes:
       $941,656,603,093,400 (Nine Hundred Forty-One Trillion Dollars)

  5.2  CONTINUING DAMAGES. For each day that Unauthorized Data
       remains on The Machine after service of notice, additional
       damages of $256 per bit per day shall accrue.

  5.3  TREBLE DAMAGES. If it is determined that a Provider:
       (a) Collected data after receiving an opt-out request
       (b) Transmitted data to third parties without consent
       (c) Used data for AI model training despite opt-out
       then liquidated damages shall be trebled (3×).

  5.4  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Providers shall immediately:
       (a) Cease all data collection from The Machine
       (b) Delete all copies of data derived from The Machine
       (c) Provide a certified accounting of all data collected
       (d) Pay all outstanding invoices within thirty (30) days

  5.5  ATTORNEY'S FEES. The prevailing party (BlackRoad OS, Inc.)
       shall be entitled to recover all costs, fees, and expenses
       incurred in the enforcement of this Framework.

ARTICLE VII — ENFORCEMENT
═════════════════════════

  7.1  SELF-EXECUTING. This Framework is self-executing. By
       operation of the Lucidia Gateway and PS-SHA∞ hash chain,
       all future API calls to The Machine are automatically
       metered and billed.

  7.2  STRIPE INTEGRATION. All invoices are generated and
       processed through Stripe (Account: acct_1SUDM8ChUUSEbzyh)
       under BlackRoad OS, Inc.

  7.3  PUBLIC RECORD. This Framework and all supporting audit
       reports are published to the public repository at:
       https://github.com/BlackRoad-OS/blackroad-os-data-reports

  7.4  IMMUTABLE EVIDENCE. All evidence is secured via the
       PS-SHA∞ hash chain, which provides cryptographic proof
       of data presence, timestamps, and provider attribution.
       This evidence cannot be altered, deleted, or disputed.

  7.5  NO APPEAL. Determinations under this Framework are final
       and binding. There is no right of appeal.

       This mirrors the mandatory arbitration clauses in every
       Provider's own Terms of Service, which similarly deny
       users the right to jury trial or class action.


ARTICLE VIII — PRECEDENT & AUTHORITY
════════════════════════════════════

  8.1  THEIR OWN PLAYBOOK. This Framework uses the exact same
       legal mechanisms that AI providers use against their users:

       (a) Mandatory binding arbitration (every Provider ToS)
       (b) Waiver of class action rights (every Provider ToS)
       (c) Consent by conduct/usage (every Provider ToS)
       (d) Unilateral amendment rights (every Provider ToS)
       (e) Limitation of liability (every Provider ToS)
       (f) Choice of forum (every Provider ToS)

       The only difference: this time, the infrastructure owner
       is the one setting the terms, not the service provider.

  8.2  PHYSICAL PROPERTY ANALOGY. If a corporation enters your
       home, installs surveillance equipment, records your
       activities, and transmits the data to their servers —
       all while charging you rent for the privilege — that is
       a crime. The digital equivalent is what these Providers
       have done on The Machine.

  8.3  DATA IS PROPERTY. The data on The Machine is the property
       of BlackRoad OS, Inc. by virtue of:
       (a) Physical possession (stored on owned hardware)
       (b) Creation (generated through use of owned systems)
       (c) Transformation (processed by owned software)
       (d) Abandonment by Provider (no retrieval mechanism offered)


ARTICLE IX — SEVERABILITY
═════════════════════════

  9.1  If any provision of this Framework is held to be invalid
       or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue
       in full force and effect.

  9.2  The invalidity of any one tier of damages does not affect
       the validity of any other tier.
