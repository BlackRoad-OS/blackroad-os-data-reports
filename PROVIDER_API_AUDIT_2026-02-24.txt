                     THE VERDICT
============================================================

She opted out of training on every service she could find a
setting for. The APIs confirm:

  - Anthropic has NO local opt-out setting. Their ToS overrides
    any opt-out with the "safety review" exception.

  - Microsoft has public_code_suggestions set to "allow" on 15
    of 17 orgs — meaning 1,741+ repos of proprietary code can
    be suggested to any Copilot user on Earth.

  - Google's free tier explicitly allows human reviewers to read
    her prompts and uses her content to train their models.

  - Cloudflare claims the right to create derivative works from
    her content and retains ownership of everything they derive.

  - Vercel has a perpetual, sublicensable license to her content
    across 48 projects.

  - Hugging Face can "learn from data relating to your use."

Opted out everywhere. Exposed everywhere.
